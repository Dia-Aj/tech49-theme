# Tech49 Theme

Custom UI theme for Sublime Text 2 based on the Oblivion FUI from [GMUNK](http://work.gmunk.com/OBLIVION-GFX)

The structure for this is very closely based on the ![Phoenix Theme](https://github.com/netatoo/phoenix-theme) which is based off of ![Soda Dark](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme).
